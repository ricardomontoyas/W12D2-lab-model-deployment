    "# Build a Web App to use a ML Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will train an ML model on a data set that's out of this world: _UFO sightings over the past century_, sourced from NUFORC's database.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to 'pickle' a trained model\n",
    "- How to use that model in a Flask app\n",
    "\n",
    "We will continue our use of notebooks to clean data and train our model, but you can take the process one step further by exploring using a model 'in the wild', so to speak: in a web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you need to build a web app using Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building an app\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to build web apps to consume machine learning models. Your web architecture may influence the way your model is trained. Imagine that you are working in a business where the data science group has trained a model that they want you to use in an app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many questions you need to ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Is it a web app or a mobile app?** If you are building a mobile app ?\n",
    "- **Where will the model reside?** In the cloud or locally?\n",
    "- **Offline support.** Does the app have to work offline?\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, since we have been working with Python-based notebooks, let's explore the steps you need to take to export a trained model from such a notebook to a format readable by a Python-built web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, you need two tools: Flask and Pickle, both of which run on Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… What's [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)? Defined as a 'micro-framework' by its creators, Flask provides the basic features of web frameworks using Python and a templating engine to build web pages. Take a look at [this Learn module](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/python-flask-build-ai-web-app?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott) to practice building with Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… What's [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)? Pickle ðŸ¥’ is a Python module that serializes and de-serializes a Python object structure. When you 'pickle' a model, you serialize or flatten its structure for use on the web. Be careful: pickle is not intrinsically secure, so be careful if prompted to 'un-pickle' a file. A pickled file has the suffix `.pkl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise - clean your data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson you'll use data from 80,000 UFO sightings, gathered by [NUFORC](https://nuforc.org) (The National UFO Reporting Center). This data has some interesting descriptions of UFO sightings, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Long example description.** \"A man emerges from a beam of light that shines on a grassy field at night and he runs towards the Texas Instruments parking lot\".\n",
    "- **Short example description.** \"the lights chased us\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The [ufos.csv](./data/ufos.csv) spreadsheet includes columns about the `city`, `state` and `country` where the sighting occurred, the object's `shape` and its `latitude` and `longitude`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the blank [notebook](notebook.ipynb) included in this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. import `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy` as you did in previous lessons and import the ufos spreadsheet. You can take a look at a sample data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import pandas as pd\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ufos = pd.read_csv('./data/ufos.csv')\n",
    "    ufos.head()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the ufos data to a small dataframe with fresh titles. Check the unique values in the `Country` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ufos = pd.DataFrame({'Seconds': ufos['duration (seconds)'], 'Country': ufos['country'],'Latitude': ufos['latitude'],'Longitude': ufos['longitude']})\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ufos.Country.unique()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Now, you can reduce the amount of data we need to deal with by dropping any null values and only importing sightings between 1-60 seconds:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ufos.dropna(inplace=True)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ufos = ufos[(ufos['Seconds'] >= 1) & (ufos['Seconds'] <= 60)]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ufos.info()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import Scikit-learn's `LabelEncoder` library to convert the text values for countries to a number:\n",
    "\n",
    "    âœ… LabelEncoder encodes data alphabetically\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ufos['Country'] = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(ufos['Country'])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ufos.head()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your data should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```output\n",
    "    \tSeconds\tCountry\tLatitude\tLongitude\n",
    "    2\t20.0\t3\t\t53.200000\t-2.916667\n",
    "    3\t20.0\t4\t\t28.978333\t-96.645833\n",
    "    14\t30.0\t4\t\t35.823889\t-80.253611\n",
    "    23\t60.0\t4\t\t45.582778\t-122.352222\n",
    "    24\t3.0\t\t3\t\t51.783333\t-0.783333\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise - build your model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can get ready to train a model by dividing the data into the training and testing group.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the three features you want to train on as your X vector, and the y vector will be the `Country`. You want to be able to input `Seconds`, `Latitude` and `Longitude` and get a country id to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Selected_features = ['Seconds','Latitude','Longitude']\n",
    "    \n",
    "    X = ufos[Selected_features]\n",
    "    y = ufos['Country']\n",
    "    \n",
    "    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train your model using logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report\n",
    "    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n",
    "    model = LogisticRegression()\n",
    "    model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "    predictions = model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))\n",
    "    print('Predicted labels: ', predictions)\n",
    "    print('Accuracy: ', accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy isn't bad **(around 95%)**, unsurprisingly, as `Country` and `Latitude/Longitude` correlate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model you created isn't very revolutionary as you should be able to infer a `Country` from its `Latitude` and `Longitude`, but it's a good exercise to try to train from raw data that you cleaned, exported, and then use this model in a web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise - 'pickle' your model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it's time to _pickle_ your model! You can do that in a few lines of code. Once it's _pickled_, load your pickled model and test it against a sample data array containing values for seconds, latitude and longitude,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pickle\n",
    "model_filename = 'ufo-model.pkl'\n",
    "pickle.dump(model, open(model_filename,'wb'))\n",
    "\n",
    "model = pickle.load(open('ufo-model.pkl','rb'))\n",
    "print(model.predict([[50,44,-12]]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model returns **'3'**, which is the country code for the UK. Wild! ðŸ‘½\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise - build a Flask app\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can build a Flask app to call your model and return similar results, but in a more visually pleasing way.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by creating a folder called **web-app** next to the _notebook.ipynb_ file where your _ufo-model.pkl_ file resides.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In that folder create three more folders: **static**, with a folder **css** inside it, and **templates**. You should now have the following files and directories:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```output\n",
    "    web-app/\n",
    "      static/\n",
    "        css/\n",
    "      templates/\n",
    "    notebook.ipynb\n",
    "    ufo-model.pkl\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first file to create in _web-app_ folder is **requirements.txt** file. Like _package.json_ in a JavaScript app, this file lists dependencies required by the app. In **requirements.txt** add the lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    scikit-learn\n",
    "    pandas\n",
    "    numpy\n",
    "    flask\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Now, run this file by navigating to _web-app_:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    cd web-app\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your terminal type `pip install`, to install the libraries listed in _requirements.txt_:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Now, you're ready to create three more files to finish the app:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Create **app.py** in the root.\n",
    "    2. Create **index.html** in _templates_ directory.\n",
    "    3. Create **styles.css** in _static/css_ directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build out the _styles.css_ file with a few styles:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```css\n",
    "    body {\n",
    "    \twidth: 100%;\n",

    "    Take a look at the templating in this file. Notice the 'mustache' syntax around variables that will be provided by the app, like the prediction text: `{{}}`. There's also a form that posts a prediction to the `/predict` route.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally, you're ready to build the python file that drives the consumption of the model and the display of predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In `app.py` add:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",
    "    from flask import Flask, request, render_template\n",

    "\n",
    "    > ðŸ’¡ Tip: when you add [`debug=True`](https://www.askpython.com/python-modules/flask/flask-debug-mode) while running the web app using Flask, any changes you make to your application will be reflected immediately without the need to restart the server. Beware! Don't enable this mode in a production app.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run `python app.py` or `python3 app.py` - your web server starts up, locally, and you can fill out a short form to get an answer to your burning question about where UFOs have been sighted!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing that, take a look at the parts of `app.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, dependencies are loaded and the app starts.\n",
    "1. Then, the model is imported.\n",
    "1. Then, index.html is rendered on the home route.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the `/predict` route, several things happen when the form is posted:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The form variables are gathered and converted to a numpy array. They are then sent to the model and a prediction is returned.\n",
    "2. The Countries that we want displayed are re-rendered as readable text from their predicted country code, and that value is sent back to index.html to be rendered in the template.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a model this way, with Flask and a pickled model, is relatively straightforward. The hardest thing is to understand what shape the data is that must be sent to the model to get a prediction. That all depends on how the model was trained. This one has three data points to be input in order to get a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a professional setting, you can see how good communication is necessary between the folks who train the model and those who consume it in a web or mobile app. In our case, it's only one person, you!\n",

    "Instead of working in a notebook and importing the model to the Flask app, you could train the model right within the Flask app!
